# HoundDog.ai GitHub Action

## Overview

HoundDog.ai's code scanner is designed to proactively detect issues related to sensitive data mishandling and leakages
early in the development cycle. By using the applicationâ€™s source code as the source of truth, security teams can ensure
data security controls are integrated from the start, rather than later when the data is already in production. This
shift-left approach reduces the risk of breaches from issues involving sensitive data being stored in logs, files,
tokens, cookies, or when shared through APIs and with third-party systems.

## Supported Programming Languages

* Java
* SQL
* GraphQL
* OpenAPI / Swagger
